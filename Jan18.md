Chapter 1 Operating Systems 

- Modern computer consists of 
	- lots of hardware
		- one or more processor
		- main memory 
		- Disk 
		- Printers
		- A keyboard
		- A mouse
		- Displays
		- Network Interfaces
		- Various other Input/ output devices

- The applications you see on your computer has been developed by a person 
- developer = application programmer 
- Application programmer perspectives 

- you dont worry about how the conversion takes place you just worry about developing the code
	- you dont have to worrry about the hardware level programming becasue of the opersting system 

	- operating system takes care of how the applications compunicate to the hardware

	-MANAGING....


	Software - Operating system --> (User mode and kernel mode) 
		-User mode
			- Application: Web browser, Email reader, Music player, Visual studio code 
				- do not have access to the hardware
			- User interface program: Terminal, GUI (graphical user interface)(double clicking on an icon and it opens),  windows:command prompt, shell, 
				- helps run other applications n your computer 
				- makes use of operating system so it can use the hardware
				- lower level user mode : shell or GUI
		- Kernel mode (aka Supervisor mode)
			- operating system completes all modual operations
			- operating system: has complete access of hardware
			- Rest - Subset of machine instructions 
			

	Hardware - 


Difference between OS (operating system) and normal S/W (softwares)  --> hard to draw a clear boundary

Email reader
.c : takes care of the clock interupt handeler 
Some user mode softwares helps the operating systems --> change password

Difference between OS and other software 
- OS is huge, complex and long lived 
	- linux or Windows operating systems have 5 million of lines of code if you include all of the source code liibraries it is 70 million lines of code(Windows) --> not easy to update

	- when updating your phone you are updating the OS --> to update a OS it is a complex job --> you need to know what all lines of code are doing

	- We will write simulations (write a simulation code for scheduling algorithms) 

What is an Operating system?
- to create abstraction for a programmer so they dont have to worry about the hardware 
- act as an intermediate person between the hardware and the user 
- whose job is to provide user programs with a better, simpler, cleaner, model of the computer and to handle managing all the resources (BOOK DEFINITION) 



The operating system is an extended machine
